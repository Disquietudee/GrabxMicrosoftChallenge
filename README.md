Grab Challenge (AI)

Problem Statement 

With the resources of telematics data for each trip and the label which classify whether the trip is considered dangerous. Derive a model that can detect driving trips 

Understand the dataset

For the telematics data for each trip, it possesses the information about the following features/columns.

bookingID: trip id
Accuracy: accuracy inferred by GPS in meters
Bearing: GPS bearing
acceleration_x: accelerometer reading in x axis (m/s2)
acceleration_y: accelerometer reading in y axis (m/s2)
acceleration_z: accelerometer reading in z axis (m/s2)
gyro_x: gyroscope reading in x axis (rad/s)
gyro_y: gyroscope reading in y axis (rad/s)
gyro_z: gyroscope reading in z axis (rad/s)
second: time of the record by number of seconds
Speed: speed measured in GPS in m/s
